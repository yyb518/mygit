/**
 * Mixin trait for an Executor
 * which groups multiple nested `Runnable.run()` calls
 * into a single Runnable passed to the original
 * Executor. This can be a useful optimization
 * because it bypasses the original context's task
 * queue and keeps related (nested) code on a single
 * thread which may improve CPU affinity. However,
 * if tasks passed to the Executor are blocking
 * or expensive, this optimization can prevent work-stealing
 * and make performance worse. Also, some ExecutionContext
 * may be fast enough natively that this optimization just
 * adds overhead.
 * The default ExecutionContext.global is already batching
 * or fast enough not to benefit from it; while
 * `fromExecutor` and `fromExecutorService` do NOT add
 * this optimization since they don't know whether the underlying
 * executor will benefit from it.
 * A batching executor can create deadlocks if code does
 * not use `scala.concurrent.blocking` when it should,
 * because tasks created within other tasks will block
 * on the outer task completing.
 * This executor may run tasks in any order, including LIFO order.
 * There are no ordering guarantees.
 *
 * WARNING: The underlying Executor's execute-method must not execute the submitted Runnable
 * in the calling thread synchronously. It must enqueue/handoff the Runnable.
